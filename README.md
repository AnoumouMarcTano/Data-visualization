# Data-visualization: Analysis of COVID-19 Trends from 2020 to 2022
The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted widespread global repercussions, compelling policymakers to implement effective strategies to navigate the crisis. In response, our project endeavors to develop an RShiny dashboard tailored for policymakers, offering comprehensive insights into the evolution of the epidemic. This dashboard facilitates cross-country comparisons, providing a holistic view of the pandemic's impact.

Developed collaboratively with two classmates for academic purposes, this project's source code is available in app.R, with cleaned data stored in data_eur.RData and sf_data_eur.RData (for mapping). Detailed operational information and the project's purpose are outlined in the 'Rapport_DADJEDJI_NOUCHET_TANO' document. You can access the app via the following link: https://kwaminouchet.shinyapps.io/EuropeCOVID_ShinyApp/

It's worth noting that while the application serves its intended purpose, there may be room for improvements. Therefore, any suggestions for future projects are welcome.
